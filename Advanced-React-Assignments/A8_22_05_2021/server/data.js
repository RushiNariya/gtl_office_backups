      "React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and you can use as little or as much React as you need. Whether you want to get a taste of React, add some interactivity to a simple HTML page, or start a complex React-powered app, the links in this section will help you get started. React is a JavaScript library that aims to simplify the development of visual interfaces. Developed at Facebook and released to the world in 2013, it drives some of the most widely used apps, powering Facebook and Instagram among countless other applications.Its primary goal is to make it easy to reason about an interface and its state at any point in time. It does this by dividing the UI into a collection of components. You might experience some initial difficulties when learning React. But once it \"clicks\", I guarantee it's going to be one of the best experiences you ever have. React makes many things easier, and its ecosystem is filled with great libraries. To start with, I highly recommend one approach, and that's using the officially recommended tool called create-react-app. create-react-app is a command line application, aimed at getting you up to speed with React in no time. A React component is usually created in its own file, because that's how we can easily reuse it (by importing it) in other components. One of the best features of React is that we can easily embed JavaScript into JSX.",

      '“Friends” was easy TV at an elite level. So many jokes, so much body comedy, so many surprises and awwws, and squeals of live-studio audience excitement. Hairdressers were doing — and not infrequently botching — the Rachel. Coffee shops became people’s second homes. Tens of millions of Americans watched all of that writing and directing and acting, all of that seemingly effortless effort, for all 10 of its years. That work and a country’s devotion to it feels like proof of a golden age of something. “Friends” debuted on NBC in the fall of 1994, ran for an entire decade, typically had around 25 to 30 million viewers a week (sometimes many more).Familiarity is the magnet of every decent American sitcom. The “com” can’t compete alone and neither can the “sit,” even though, together, they’re obviously quite the sandwich. But the many nights I’ve spent recumbent on my sofa laughing at, say, Ross and Phoebe debating evolution, or Phoebe, Joey and Ross impersonating Chandler, or Chandler blanching at Monica’s desperate new cornrows or Rachel taking forever to tell somebody who the father of her baby is — those nights have never really been about the situation comedy of “Friends.” They’ve only ever been about us — me and these six people — and my apparently enduring need to know what they’re up to and how they are, even though I’ve known for 25 years.',

      "Click on medical school admissions guide and you will find a plethora of helpful hints on getting into med school. The site's special reports give you more than any individual post can deliver. They are either a thorough deep dive into a specific topic, or a collection of posts and articles on that topic. In either case, they give you more than an individual post can. All are free; the site specifically says \"download as many as you want.\" By the way, the site also can help prospective law school studentsâ€¦but that's another topic, another day. This blog is all about the dubious, bad and sometimes lunatic developments in the medical world. It will cover not only the science, but also the human and social side of medicine. And it isn't afraid to poke fun at those who cry out to have fun poked at them. A U.K. based site, so beware of the English-isms and U.K. pounds. Other than that, fun, informative, thought-provoking.",

      "NASA has released rare, never-before-seen footage of researchers looking for signs of life in the samples brought back by the Apollo 11 astronauts in 1969. The footage shows biologists and chemists at NASA’s Ames Research Center in California working in a specially designed clean room and applying the most sophisticated analytical techniques of the time to search for life. Staff at Ames had been searching the center's archives for unique Apollo artifacts to showcase as the agency prepares to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Apollo Moon landing on July 20. The footage was recorded on an obsolete 16-mm film format and was digitized and remastered for public release. When NASA sent the first astronauts to the Moon, scientists couldn’t rule out the possibility that our nearest neighbor might contain life. The analyses, conducted both at Ames and Johnson Space Center in Houston, conclusively proved that the Moon was, as suspected, bereft of living organisms. Nevertheless, these tests became the first time that NASA looked for the possibility of life existing on another world using samples from that world.  “We were really concerned about contaminating the samples with our own bacteria,” said Caye Johnson, biologist from Ames, now retired, who worked with the Apollo lunar samples. “We had to be careful that we didn’t introduce a microbe into the samples and then falsely say that we’d found life.”",
